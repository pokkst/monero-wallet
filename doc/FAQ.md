Not supported just yet.

## The app always crashes as soon as I open a wallet!
Users of Zenfone MAX & Zenfone 2 Laser (possibly others) **MUST** use the armeabi-v7a APK as the arm64-v8a build uses hardware AES
functionality these models don't have. If this does not help, please report the problem.

## I am having problems with my BTC transaction
That's unfortunate, but this isn't a BTC wallet.
